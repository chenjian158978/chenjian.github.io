### Silver Words

> Baby I ain't joking
> 
> And it's not what I'm smoking
> 
> I really think you're nice
>
> Don't think I'm kidding
> 
> And don't think that I'm bidding
> 
> If silver words are your price
>
> \~~~
> 
> But oh if you could see
> 
> The change you've made in me
>
> That the angels in the skies
> 
> Were envious and surprised
> 
> That anyone as nice as you
> 
> Would chance with me
>
> \~~~

### 银色告白

### HALFWAY UP THE STAIRS

I have just received a CD called 'Rock On' which features Delroy Wilson's version of 'Halfway Up The Stairs'. Here is a extract from the sleeve notes:

> "Halfway Up The Stairs", along with "Silver Words", was written and released by a Detroit artists named Rodriguez, born Sixto Diaz Rodriguez in 1942. Both songs were found on Rodriguez's Coming From Reality album, recorded in London and released in 1971 on the Sussex label, distributed by A&M in the USA. Sixto Rodriguez started his career on the US Impact label in the mid sixties and still lives in Detroit to this day.

-- John Samson, SA Rock Digest, 17th June 2002

我刚刚收到一个叫《Rock On》的CD，它就像Delroy Wilson版本的《Halfway Up The Stairs》。光盘介绍里有个摘录：

> "Halfway Up The Stairs"，以及"Silver Words"是由一个底特律艺术家创作并发行的，他叫Sixto Diaz Rodriguez，生于1942年。这两首歌曲均在Rodriguez的专辑《Coming From Reality》中，其在伦敦录音并于1971年以贴有Sussex公司标签发行，由A&M在美国售卖。Sixto Rodriguez于六十世纪中期在US Impact公司下开始了他的职业生涯，并且现在仍然生活在底特律。
